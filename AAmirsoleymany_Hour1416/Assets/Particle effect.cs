// Made this cool lightning effect by messing with things, so I might miss a thing or 2.
// First is a color modification into a blue effect,
//Then I gave it Trails
//Then I modified those trails to be Ribbons
// I gave the effect some gravity, not alot, but make it more squished ,
// Then I Lowered the Max Particles,
// Gave the generation some curve
// Increased the Sim. Speed
// Gave it some rotation speed
// Some Light effects, (Which may or may not function)
// And I *THINK* that was everything I kept on it.
