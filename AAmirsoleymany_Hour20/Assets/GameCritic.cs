 * Game is too easy, Power ups too big, obstacles too small. 
 * Changes I would make, shrink the power ups, grow the obstacles.
 * To give "Wow" factor, give it explosions and maybe a catchy soundtrack
 * Reasons why its fun;
 * The game feels like a discount subway surfer.
 * Its not difficult, but it takes patience combined with skill to actually get anywhere, the amount of obstacles can make loss of focus in a competetive setting very hard
 * Reasons why its tedious
 * The game feels like a discount subway surfer.
 * The game is slow, and has no real incentive to play. There are not coins, or an active score except what you get at the end.

 * Changes, I increased the cube size to be longer, so the phase button has purpose now. Kept it red though, standard stuff.
 * and I am going to mess with the power up by giving it light blue particles, rather than yellow on yellow.
